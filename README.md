# NunAtm

This is an ATM Locater iOS Based application that serves to notify the user whether an ATM within their radius is online or offline. This aims to simply the problem
of unavailable ATMs leading to the inconvenience of time wasted. The App is Soley based in Southern Africa, or wherever the leading banks are situated. 

The App is yet to be completed fully, however main functionality is present. The use of API's such as Google Maps, Google Firebase, Firestore and Directions are the
main API's used. The functionality of being able to vote from an anonymous user (No Profile Implementation has been made as yet TBA). Voting is registered and updates
the relevant UI within the app to confirm or deny the status of the ATM. 

It is a project that i've been working to pushing, it shall be done. With more updates in the future. Stay Tuned.
